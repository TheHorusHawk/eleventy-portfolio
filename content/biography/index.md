# My Biography

A short biography of the author.

I was born at some time in the past and will probably die at some point in the future. [^1]

Also, other things happened. Mostly abroad, if I'm being honest. And if I keep being honest, I don't know as much about those things as about some of the things that happened at home. That's just how it is. I supposed things that happened far away aren't as relevant as things that happened close-by, but the truth is there's some chauvinism involved, isn't there, and these days things that happen really far can impact us profoundly, such is the interconnected nature of the world, so maybe I should be paying attention, but I don't speak that many foreign languages and it's hard and also I only have one life, and if I don't, I don't maintain knowledge of other languages through the reincarnations.


All these factors have come together and culminated in the present moment, where I'm now writing this.[^2]

[^1]: To the best knowledge of the author, these words are true at the moment of writing. No liability accepted for any changes (such as death) between now and the moment you are reading this.

[^2]: I was writing this at the moment when I wrote it, I'm not writing that anymore, I'm now writing this footnote, and I'm certainly not writing this at the moment you are reading it, which is after I've finished writing both the paragraph above and this footnote. Who knows what I'm doing now that you are reading this. I may be sleeping for all we know.
