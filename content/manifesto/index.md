# My Manifesto

I think this is how art should be!

I assume you have stopped reading now, because no one reads manifestos anymore. If anyone ever read them. I mean people don't read anything anymore do they, they just youtube it, or netflix it, or whatever. Anyway, thank you for not reading, if you're reading well, then you probably have some deeply held art concepts of your own and I don't want to alienate you today by writing something that goes against them so trust your instinct and leave it at that.

End.
