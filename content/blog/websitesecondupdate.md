This week the website went live on GitHub pages! It's nice and easy to get a website up and running via a repository. As I had already started the repository, git was refusing to merge but that was easily solved. Nice to use git, as always. Every time something doesn't go my way I understand what why it's acting in the way that it is and I can just focus on how to solve the problem, deepening my understanding as I go about doing it. Maybe it's just that it has really clear error messages - or that my use of it is basic enough that it doesn't get confusing - but it really helps with keeping the frustration at bay.

Now, for the theme. I looked at different options for themes but didn't find anything that fit what I wanted, so I just rolled up my sleeves and started tweaking the base template to bring it closer to what I wanted. I was kind of dreading having to learn Jinja to do it, but it turns out it's very similar to the templating language Django uses (the imaginatively called Django Templating Language, or DTL) so it was a breeze to get it to do the five or six things I had big issues with.

Having said that, I may opt for a different theme in the future. I'm not totally happy with how it looks now. I may find a suitable theme, keep tweaking notmyidea, make a new one altogether or a combination of the above. We'll see. But I can live with what it looks like for now, so I can focus on just publishing articles and expanding the site.

That rolls quite nicely to the third point on my update: I also rewrote some of the stuff here. Have a look around and enjoy. Articles are now labeled and sorted with a date corresponding to their latest modification, or its creation, if there was no modification. So on the home page (click the title to get to it) all articles will be listed in order of newest to oldest, so anything towards the top is the newer stuff.

That would be all if it weren't for the fact that I also changed the About Me page, which won't show up in the list of articles on the home page (being what Pelican refers to as a "page", which behaves a little differently from other content, but you don't have to worry about that). So, if you're interested in me (and why wouldn't you be?) and/or don't want to miss any changes, remember to also navigate there via the menu above.

Also, this has been taking up all of my development time, so there will be no updates on my Games Arena project this week. Sorry about that.

And that's it for this week's update! Really happy to have a website up and running and learning Pelican/Jinja while I do it. It's nice to have a place to showcase my work and to direct people to.

Until next week!
