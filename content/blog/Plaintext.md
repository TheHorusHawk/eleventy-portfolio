I just watched a really enlightening lecture on plain text, titled 'There's no such thing as plain text', delivered by Dylan Beattie as part of NDC Copenhagen

It goes through the history of encoding standards for characters, with some funny anecdotes peppered in. The lecturer makes you rethink the most basic assumptions you have, on things which seem obvious to humans but which computers and cultures conspire to make really unintuitive, such as alphabetical order.

It forces us to reckon with our interactions with machines as rooted in culture and history, which is a perspective I rather enjoyed, and find important in navigating our current cultural landscape, digital and otherwise.

The same lecturer also has a very interesting lecture, delivered at this year's CDN conference, in Oslo, on Email. Again he furnishes us with a historical perspective which is most enlightening and entertaining.

One to keep watching out for. Here's a link in case you're interested.

Also, here's a link to my vscode with the Fira Code font. Look how attractive those arrow functions become! And how handsome is that strict equality operator?
