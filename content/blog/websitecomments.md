This week I fiddled with my template a bit more. It's been fun to get to understand better and better Pelican's functionalities. The biggest most visible change is that I've added a comments section using utterances, which uses github's issues. That's a simple and elegant solution that doesn't require me to add another provider like DISQUS. The only downside is that you need to have a Github account to leave comments, which I realise is not everyone. So, sorry if you want to leave a comment but don't have a Github account. I'd say leave a comment to let me know but, well, the moment you do that, then it's not a problem anymore, is it?

I've made some other small changes, such as the pages' titles.
