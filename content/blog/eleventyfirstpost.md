Just made a static website with 11ty (this one) which I'm getting live on Netlify via Github. Very happy to have this one running, as I can put my creative content to one side and focus on doing web development updates here. 

I'm especially keen to be making use of the vast npm modules ecosystem. In fact, I've already added one to this website[^1]. 

Since this is a portfolio website, I've added a <a href="/form">form</a> and some Bootstrap components, such as an accordion on the four noble truths of <a href="/buddhism">buddhism</a>, a <a href="#">navbar</a>.

While on this course, I've made two other websites, one advertising a non-existent band and another one linking to different projects I've made over the years, which had a small section with a JavaScript fetch call (which renders information on the phase of the moon.)

It's been great, but it also has meant I've had to put other projects, such as the Games Arena, on hold.
