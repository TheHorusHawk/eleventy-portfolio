Hey everyone,

My Games Arena project is approaching completion. The Tictactoe game is fully implemented, with end of game checks the last piece of the puzzle. I also added a convenience button to restart the game at any point, mainly for testing. 

I'm now implementing an invite to a match button next to the available players and fixing some issues, like there's maybe a bug around where the first player plays as the second player once in a blue moon for some reason but I haven't been able to replicate it lately and so can't do much about it until I find it happening again. If it's even there.

To see it approaching its end is a really a special moment for me, as this is the first django project I do from scratch, with no seed code and no spec to follow, just me thinking of something to do and doing it. I've been working on it for a few months, whenever I could find the time. I've learned so much doing it that I resent the way I implemented things in the beginning. It was meant as a final project for my Web Programming with Python and Javascript course. When I do finish it, it will be a definite programming milestone for me.

That's it. No new bells and whistles to report, just good old HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript and Python-Django.

It works though. And that's nothing short of a mistery to me. Though maybe I shouldn't be celebrating too soon.
