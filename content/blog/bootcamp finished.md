Well, that flew by.

Today marks the day I received my certificate for completing a bootcamp in Crucial Skills for Web Design and Development.

It's been a lovely experience, to connect with my peers starting off in this adventure and my teachers who're further ahead, sharing their knowledge. I thank everyone who's made this possible and hope to see everyone of my colleagues and peers at the Coder's Guild out there in the coding universe.

There might be some follow up to the above but it's all hush hush so I'll just leave it at that for now. 

Happy coding!
