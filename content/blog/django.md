Django is a lovely framework for web applications, which has been a delight to use. 

The one drawback of using it versus using Node.JS is that I have to flip back and forth between the two languages when switching from programming client-side to server-side. This can be cumbersome when programming interactions between client-side and server-side. 

However, this is more than amply compensated by:

- It's in Python! I find it more intuitive to program in Python, it's a more straightforward language which isn't burdened by many years of history which it must remain backwards compatible with. This makes debuging, specifically, more straightforward.
- MTV/MVC. Python is a Model-View-Controller framework or, rather, a Model-Template-View. As an out-of-the-box, fully featured MTV framework, django forces this development pattern onto the programmer, which, for me, has been a delight, as it I have enjoyed it greatly.
- I just like it. At the end of the day, for me, it's about making sure there's enough features while not being too cumbersome to configure/operate. I can get into a flow state, programming away to make the application without hitting hurdles such as strange bugs or configuration tweaks that need a long process of googling to get to. Sure, that's also a function of already having done this work for the hurdles I did find in the past, so it may speak less to how good it is than to how much I've already invested in it. However, this doesn't really matter to me, as I'm not trying to be impartial, just trying to find what works for me.

Since django has become my framework of choice, it gets harder to compare it to any of my previous experience, as the things I'm doing with it I haven't done in **any** framework and have only the experience of django to go by. I may update this in future if I have more experience in other frameworks, but I probably won't.
